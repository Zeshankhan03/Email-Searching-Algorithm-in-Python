# Email-Searching-Algorithm-in-Python
I have done Email searching Algorithm using Python as an Assignment in my Operating Systems Course. The Algorithm is used to find and extract the email address from all the data that is in the file and will create a new file with the name extracted file and all the emails that have been found will be there.

Requirements:

      1) install the module re "pip install re"
      2) install the wordlist module "pip install wordlist"
      3) The file from which you want to search the email addresses should be in the project directory.
      
NOTE: I have uploaded the report of the Assignment for the help and understanding of the Task.
